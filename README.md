# CodeEval Challenges

The files in this repository are the different ways I went about solving the many challenges found on CodeEval. I made this repo public so that all of you can see how the challenges may be solved, in as many languages that I know. 

Please do not simply copy and paste this code into CodeEval as a quick means to get a higher score. It will lower both of our scores, and you will have not learned anything. If you have a question about some of the code, feel free to message me directly and I will gladly explain any of my code.

Here is the status of all the challenges. The checked off challenges are completed, and the unchecked ones still need to be coded. All the challenges that are checked off have been tested for errors and successfully passed the CodeEval Test.
